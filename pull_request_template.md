## What?
This is where you let the reviewer know the overall effect of the PR. Reference a ticket in your issue tracker if appropriate, but by all means, don’t just reference the ticket.

## Why?
The “why” tells us what business or engineering goal this change achieves.

## How?
Help the reviewer out with a little more info. Explain why you decided to do it that way. This will help the reviewer understand your reasoning and, in turn, provide a better review.

## Testing?
Therefore, it is important to let the reviewer know how you tested them, in case you cannot verify them in the tests. Alternatively, you can explain to the reviewer how to test it locally, if necessary.

## Screenshots (optional)
Of course, screenshots are especially useful for UI-related changes. A simple before and after screenshot, or the current state compared to your vision of local development, helps the reviewer tremendously.
